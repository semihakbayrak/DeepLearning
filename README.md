# DeepLearning

- Deep latent variable model for relational learning and variational inference with backpropagation(all the derivations can be found in the folder)

- Convolutional Neural Networks (implemented from scratch) for text classification(all the derivations can be found in the folder)

- Neural Collaborative Filtering (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031) with implicit responses. As I expected, it doesn't perform well.

- Character level RNN for name classification is implemented with Julia language deep learning package Flux. Almost same implementation with https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html

- Lorenz system dynamics are learned with LSTM networks.
